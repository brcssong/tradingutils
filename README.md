trading utils for penny-stock recommendations using technical analysis and ML-powered return predictions.  eventually, the goal is to combine both into a novel, terminal-like interface where users can choose stocks and minimalistically monitor prices/candles of the selected tickers, and trade using simple+effortless commands.
